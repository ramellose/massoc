<h2>What does <em>massoc</em> do?</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to improve microbial network inference and analysis.<br />What do we mean with improvement?</p>
<p>Firstly, existing network inference tools are not uniform in their input and output settings. This not only makes such tools harder to use, it also makes them difficult to compare to eachother. <br />Hence, <strong><em>massoc</em></strong>'s first contribution to network inference is its dedication to <a href="https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples">FAIR data</a>; Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproducible. <strong><em>massoc</em> </strong>uses the <a href="http://biom-format.org/">BIOM format</a> as input, as this data format combines rich metadata with sparse data storage. It creates rich XML graphs from the original BIOM file and newly inferred networks. This XML file can then be read into your preferred network visualization tool (e.g. Cytoscape). <em><strong>massoc</strong> </em>also accepts tab-delimited files.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are few analytical methods targeted towards microbial networks. We are working on a toolset that will permit users to analyse their networks while taking taxonomic information into account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, analytical methods are still in development. However, <em><strong>massoc</strong> </em>can already run some network inference tools. For an explanation of the GUI and the command line call, check out the menu on the left. Need a quick-start guide?
